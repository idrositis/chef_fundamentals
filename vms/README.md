# VMs

A set of [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) VMs that might help playing around with
the course. To spin-up any of these VMs, you can run `vagrant up <vm_name>` under this
directory.

Available VMs as per the list below:

  - **devbox**: workstation VM with [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk)
    that manages the chef-code.

  - **node1**: VM with client tools installed (i.e. `chef-apply`)
